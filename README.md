# Problem 


- During the co-op or post-graduate job search process, the only available information is limited like job description or location. Such a description is not sufficient for job seekers to determine the value of the job. Instead, companies’ detailed information and first hand experience should be provided.
- Employees can’t get in touch with fellow colleagues through a platform like NUcareer

# Strategy

- We are planning to build a web platform for these job seekers. Workers can write reviews on the company they worked with. To get a better understanding and knowledge about a company, job seekers can see the reviews from peers. It allows companies to post positions on our website. 
- And job seekers can view all positions from different companies and make applications through our website. They can keep track of applications they made and interviews they received to see the process.
- It also allows users to make organizations. For example, one company can form its own organization of workers. And these organizations are public to all users. Job seekers can see the workers who have been working there to make a better judge to accept or reject the positions. 

# Web API you intend to use: Jobs api for extracting jobs available
- [Github Jobs](https://jobs.github.com/api)
- [Linkedin People Search](https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/people-search-api)
- [Indeed API](https://rapidapi.com/indeed/api/indeed)
